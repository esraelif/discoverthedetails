Discover The Details - working react application
navigate to the folder
run 'npm install'
once the dependencies are installed run 'npm start'

Setup Components:
in src create components folder
in the components create following files
Navbar.js
Hero.js
About.js
Services.js
Tours.j
Footer.js
setup components with default export (snippet - rafce)
carefully move the code from App.js into components (files)
hint - look for navbar, footer and section tags
App.js should be empty
import and render all components in App.js (try auto imports)
result is going to be the same, it's just easier to manage the code
again, it's just my preference to split up code in such way.
